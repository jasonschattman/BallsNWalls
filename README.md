Balls N’ Walls uses computer animation to simulate collisions between balls rolling on a horizontal surface partitioned by walls with any angle and length.  The simulation is based on Newton's laws and conservation of energy and momentum, under the following assumptions:

•	Momentum and energy are conserved before 
and after collisions
•	The rolling surface, the balls and the walls are frictionless 
•	The balls have equal radius and mass
•	All collisions are inelastic, meaning no 
kinetic energy is lost between collisions
•	Balls bounce off walls at symmetrical angles 
•	Rotation and spin effects are ignored
•	Gravitational forces between balls are ignored

The program offers four simulation modes:
1. Simple bouncing around a room.  Watch balls collide off each other and off walls. This is a good illustration of the ideal gas law.  You can add new walls to the room at any time by clicking and dragging.  You can also adjust the number of balls and the maximum of their initial random speeds.

2. Epidemic simulator.  This simulates the spread of a disease through a population.  Red balls represent sick people, green balls are healthy people, and blue balls are doctors.  Red balls turn green balls red, and blue balls turn red balls green.  Can you draw walls to quarantine the sick before they infect the whole population?

3. Billiards game.  You can rack and shoot billiard balls around a beautiful green table.  Balls that are "sunk" simply roll off the table but remain visible so you can easily verify that you made the shot.

4. Head-on collision.  Throw two massive clusters of balls at one another and watch what happens.  Especially fun if you try to draw a wall or two in between the oncoming hordes before they collide!
